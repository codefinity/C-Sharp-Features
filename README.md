### C# 7.3

The following new features support the theme of better performance for safe code:

- You can access fixed fields without pinning.
- You can reassign ref local variables.
- You can use initializers on stackalloc arrays.
- You can use fixed statements with any type that supports a pattern.
- You can use additional generic constraints.

The following enhancements were made to existing features:

- You can test == and != with tuple types.
- You can use expression variables in more locations.
- You may attach attributes to the backing field of auto-implemented properties.
- Method resolution when arguments differ by in has been improved.
- Overload resolution now has fewer ambiguous cases.

The new compiler options are:

- -publicsign to enable Open Source Software (OSS) signing of assemblies.
- -pathmap to provide a mapping for source directories.
